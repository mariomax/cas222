# CAS222: Integrated Website Design
## Portland Community College / Summer 2017
## Instructor: Susan Watson

This site is for Ace in the Hole MultiSports Events. The "client" provided all of the text for the site. I gathered the copyright-free images, created the logos with Adobe Illustrator, and most importantly, wrote the code.

Features include:
..* Responsive Design
..* CSS/LESS mixins and custom color palette
..* A jQuery hamburger menu
..* A JavaScript image slider
..* PHP includes files for header, nav, footer, and other segments of code
..* PHP forms that write user content to a MySQL database
..* Custom results pages to display the user's entered data
..* A custom 404 error page
..* Weather API by Weather Underground
..* Embedded Facebook and Twitter feeds
..* Favicon
