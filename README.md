# CAS222: Integrated Website Design
## Portland Community College / Summer 2017
## Instructor: Susan Watson

This site is for Ace in the Hole MultiSports Events. The "client" provided all of the text for the site. I gathered the copyright-free images, created the logos with Adobe Illustrator, and most importantly, wrote the code.

Features include:
* Responsive Design
* CSS/LESS mixins and custom color palette
* A jQuery hamburger menu
* A JavaScript image slider
* PHP includes files for header, nav, footer, and other segments of code
* PHP forms that write user content to a MySQL database
* Custom results pages to display the user's entered data
* A custom 404 error page
* Weather API by Weather Underground
* Embedded Facebook and Twitter feeds
* Browser favicon
